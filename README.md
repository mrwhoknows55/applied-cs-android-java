This repository is contains starter codes for all projects which are part of the ["Applied CS with Android"](http://g.co/cswithandroid) course.

The course has starter code repositories for each projects, but those are not compiling out of the box because:
not up to date with latest Android changes like Androidx, Gradle Plugin, newer Android SDKs etc.

So In this repository I'm migrating all these projects to work with newer Android Studio out of the box.
